# Comment-Analysis
A tool using openAI that analyzes your first few, and last few comments and says what kind of person you are based on those input values designed by Tadg O'Hare
It's very interesting to see your 'character development' as my output was much different from my 2016 comments to 2022 comments


##Running Instructions
- First, clone the repo into your directory of choice
- Get your api key from openai if you haven't already done so
- Create a new .env file and set OPENAI_API_KEY = yourapikey
- Download your instagram data
- Move comments/post_comments.json into your working directory
- Set the FILEPATH to be the path to that file under generate.py
- Run the program and be sure to have fun
